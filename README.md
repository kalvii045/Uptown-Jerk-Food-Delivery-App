# Uptown-Jerk-Food-Delivery-App
A food ordering and delivery app I made for a restaurant (Uptown Jerk) and for delivery drivers back.

The public file includes all the controller files. The views file include the actual aesthetics or simply just the html for 
how the page will look. The controller file includes functions such as render() which is the controller function for displaying 
the view pages from the controller files in public. To start, go to public/index.php and follow from there.
